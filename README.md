# intro-to-react

This is a repo I am using to learn about the ReactJS library at [Bloc](https://www.bloc.io). It therefore contains some simple examples of how to build React components with ES6.

The branches are intentionally not deleted so I can go back and look at each individual checkpoint's work.
